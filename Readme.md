Generator for Social Security Declarations no.1, 3, and 6 of the Bulgarian National Revenue Agency

# Scope
The Bulgarian NRA allows you to submit social security declarations on-line, but unfortunately the declarations follow a CSV format and can be generated by a piece of software that is Windows-only.

This repository is intended to hold Ruby scripts that implement the 2015 specifications for declarations 1, 3 and 6 found here:
- Declaration 1 Spec: http://nap.bg/document?id=5845
- Declaration 3 Spec: http://nap.bg/document?id=6416
- Declaration 6 Spec: http://nap.bg/document?id=3906


# Current Status
Currently, only a subset of the Declaration 1 Spec that applies to freelancers ("Свободна професия") is implemented.

# Usage and Configuration
Run the script with no arguments for a usage summary. You can find a configuration example in 'config.json.sample'.
